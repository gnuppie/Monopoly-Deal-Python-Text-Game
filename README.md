# Monopoly-Deal-Python-Text-Game
This was written on Jupyter Notebook, as one of my first assignments as in my introductory course on Python.

The code does not utilise objects, and was instead done with procedural programming.

This version of Monopoly Deal is a 2 to 4 player game, and does not utilise the monetary features of the actual Monopoly Deal card game. As such, cards pertaining to monetary aspects such like "It's my Birthday" and "Debt Collector" have been removed, alongside monetary values for each card.

The other rules still apply. Traditional rules can be found at monopolydealrules.com
