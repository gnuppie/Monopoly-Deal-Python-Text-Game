# Monopoly-Deal-Python-Text-Game
This was written on Jupyter Notebook, as one of my first assignments as in my introductory course on Python. I understand that the code could have been made much simpler and more efficient using classes, but at the time I was not well-versed in it yet.  This version of Monopoly Deal does not utilise the monetary features of the actual Monopoly Deal card game. As such, cards pertaining to monetary aspects such like "It's my Birthday" and "Debt Collector" have been removed, alongside monetary values for each card.  The other rules still apply. Traditional rules can be found at monopolydealrules.com
